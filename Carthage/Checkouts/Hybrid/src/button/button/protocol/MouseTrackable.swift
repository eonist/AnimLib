/**
 * Makes it possible to utilize mouseOver/mouseOut functionality on a view (Supports custom bezier path)
 * - Abstract: In order for onOut / onOver to work, we need: a few methods and variables methods: Override: `move,entered,exited,hitTest`, variables: hasMouseEntered, createTrackingArea
 * - Discussion: we use viewUnderMouse and hittest to make sure overlapping views also gets their say. Because otherwise the tracking area sort of becomes "see-through"
 * - Discussion: We do not store trackingArea in a variable, because the supertype should have as few variables as possible, to keep state simple, for now, only HasMOuseEntered is require for this solution to work
 * - Caution: ⚠️️ It's a little bit tricky to setup onOver onOut with a non-rectangular shape, so the code is a bit complex. I'm sure there are areas were the code can be improved but its not too far from being optimal
 * - Caution: ⚠️️ a view can have many tracking areas, the current workflow does not account for that, and is out-of scope for this solution
