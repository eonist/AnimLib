 * This class animates something from A to B with a easing curve attached
 * NOTE: This animation class is more like stock animation, less interuptable than "physics based animation"
 * TODO: ⚠️️ You can store the active animator instance count in the AnimatableView to know when to stop the cvdisplaylink
 * TODO: ⚠️️ Take a look at other animation libs
 * TODO: ⚠️️ Add onComplete selector callback method on init and as a variable, do the same with method, use optional to assert if they exist or not
 * TODO: ⚠️️ Seek,reverse,repeate,autoRepeat
 * TODO: ⚠️️ Implement a way so that the animator can be reused so that you can target it and disable it
